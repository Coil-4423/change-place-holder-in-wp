To change the "Add title" placeholder to something like "Add staff name" for a custom post type like Staff in WordPress, you can achieve this by adding a filter in your theme's `functions.php` file or in a custom plugin.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Locate your `functions.php` file**:
   - Go to your WordPress dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Appearance** > **Theme Editor**.
   - Find the `functions.php` file from the right-hand panel under **Theme Files**.

2. **Add the following code to the `functions.php` file**:
   This code will modify the placeholder for the title in your "Staff" custom post type editor.

   ```php
   function change_staff_title_placeholder( $title, $post ) {
       if ( 'staff' == $post->post_type ) { // 'staff' is the post type slug
           $title = 'Add staff name';
       }
       return $title;
   }
   add_filter( 'enter_title_here', 'change_staff_title_placeholder', 10, 2 );
   ```

   Make sure to replace `'staff'` with the exact slug of your custom post type if it's different.

3. **Save the changes**.

4. **Verify the changes**:
   - Now, when you go to create a new "Staff" post, the placeholder for the title should display "Add staff name" instead of "Add title."

This method modifies the placeholder only for the "Staff" post type while leaving other post types (like posts or pages) unchanged.
